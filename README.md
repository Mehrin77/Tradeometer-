# Tradeometer-
Trade-o-meter to make Quantitative Trading decision
This Shiny app allows users to upload CSV files of stock market data,
visualize buy/sell pressure using interactive Plotly gauge charts, and perform custom time-range analyses.
It supports multiple time-interval plots (e.g., 10:00-10:30) and includes data cleaning functions for accurate visualizations. 
To use, upload your data, view fixed-interval plots, or analyze custom time ranges.
Clone the repository, install dependencies (shiny, dplyr, plotly), and run the app with runApp().

The project is done for LankaBangla Securities Ltd (LBSL). LBSL is the owner of the data.
